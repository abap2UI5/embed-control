// The abap2UI5 frontend - the z2ui5 UIComponent the control wraps - is not
// shipped with the control: it comes from the abap2UI5 service the app talks
// to anyway. Every abap2UI5 installation carries its frontend (embedded in
// the ABAP classes generated from app/webapp), so the frontend always has
// the version of the backend it runs against, and a host app carries nothing
// but this file and its stylesheet.
//
//   GET  <endpoint>?z2ui5-bundle   the frontend as a script, once per page
//   POST <endpoint>                the roundtrips, one session per control
//
// Without the parameter a GET of the endpoint is abap2UI5's own page, as
// always (z2ui5_cl_ui5_http_handler=>_http_get_bundle in abap2UI5).
//
// Everything the app shows and does is decided by the ABAP class on the
// backend. This control only decides WHICH class runs, against WHICH
// endpoint, and how much room it gets. Every instance is its own abap2UI5
// session; changing app, endpoint or params starts a NEW component, restart()
// does too, and destroying the control destroys the component, which ends
// the session.
